# open-web-app-logo

I recently built an app that includes the option for downloading 
to the Apple iOS store, Google Play store - or you could just 
click to open it up in your browser and call it a day.

I looked and couldn't find a nice logo to put next to the other
two, so I made one. It's not fancy, but I particularly like the
way that the Open Web App text covers both the action for an end 
user (click to open) and also subtly reinforces the idea of an open 
web.

I did find a few logos for PWAs, but IMHO I rarely encounter an 
end user that knows what in the world a PWA is. Just calling it a
web app seems more reasonable. Offline mode for most users is just 
a feature of a web app.

The font is just [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

You can download it in a variety of formats. Released with a MIT
license. Go nuts.
